        <p>"On the Day of Resurrection, the Quran will meet its companion<br>
            who memorized it when his grave is opened, in the form of a pale man. It will ask him, 'Do you recognize me?' 
        </p>    
        <p>
            He will say, 'I do not recognize you.' It will say, 'I am your companion, the Quran, who kept you thirsty on hot days and kept you awake at night. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Every merchant benefits from his business, and today, you<br>
                will benefit from your good deeds.'" 
        </p>
        <p>(Sahih Muslim)</p>

    <h1 class="ahma">The Only Bundle You Will Ever Need</h1>
    <div id="ahmad">
        <p>Those who <strong>memorize the Quran</strong> and <strong>implement its teachings</strong> are <strong>graced with Allah’s immense rewards, elevating their place in Paradise</strong> <br> in harmony with the verses they hold in their heart. </p>
        <p>They would be asked to <strong>Recite</strong> and <strong>Rise</strong> in <strong>Jannah</strong> until the last level that they have memorized. <strong>Subhan-Allah</strong></p>
        <p>"Indeed, Allah will elevate some people with this Book, and by<br>it, He will degrade others."<strong> (Sahih Muslim)</strong></p>
        <p>Have you tried memorizing the Quran and <strong>found it hard</strong>?</p>
        <p>Maybe the Arabic words were tough, or you <strong>kept forgetting what you </strong>memorized. </p>
        <p>Or you <strong>felt all alone</strong> in this big task. Or maybe you feel like there's just <strong>never enough time</strong>. </p>
        <>With <strong>work, family, and everything else</strong>, finding a moment to sit and memorize can seem impossible. <br> If this sounds like you, <strong>I've been there too.</strong>
        <p>For years, my journey to memorize the Quran felt like navigating through  <strong>a maze without a map</strong>  , especially as a <strong>non-Arabic speaker</strong>. </p> <img id="ahmad2" src="https://quranmemorizationguide.com/cdn/shop/files/image.png?v=1683820885&width=1500" alt="">
        <p>But through persistent study and refining various techniques, <br> I've distilled the essence into what I call the '<strong>Golden Methods</strong>.' </p>
        <p>These methods were <strong>tried and tested on thousands of students </strong> and offer guaranteed results, alhamdulillah.</p><p>Many struggle with memorizing the Quran because <br> <strong>they overlook the science of memory </strong>— <strong>how our minds process and store information. </strong></p>
        <p>Had I known this earlier, my path to memorizing the Quran would have been <strong>five times faster.</strong></p>
        <p>As an example to memorize a new concept, the new idea which is in our <strong>short term memory </strong>must be <br><strong>linked to an idea in our long term memory</strong>. </p>
        <p>To make it simpler for you, think of it like this: to really remember something new, we need to <strong>connect it with something we already know well. </strong></p>
        <p>It's like tying a new string to an old one that's already strong and secure in our mind.</p><p>That was just one example.</p>
        <p>This program is rooted in the <strong>psychology of memorization, </strong>coupled with <strong>practical methods to guide your subconscious mind</strong>.</p>
        <p>It’s a blend that enables <strong>anyone, at any age, to memorize up to 4 pages of the Quran each day. </strong></p><p><strong>Ma Sha Allah.</strong></p>
